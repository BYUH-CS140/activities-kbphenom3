    <p>After visiting Japan during this past spring break, I was inspired to make a website about essential things to do and NOT to do when visiting Japan, especially for the first time.</p>
    <p>Japan is a very popular destination for vacations amongst families and individuals. </p>
    <section id="Dos">
        <h2 style="color: green; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">DOs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Passport</strong>: Really goes without saying that a passport is necessary to legally fly over there...</li>
            <li><strong>IC Card</strong>: An IC card is the most convenient method to pay for public transportation, and even normal transactions.
                An IC card application can also be downloaded on iPhones for free.
                <br><img src="images/iccard.jpg" alt="IC Cards" style="border: 2px solid black;"></li>
            <li><strong>eSIM</strong>: A temporary eSIM for internet connection while going from place to place is very convenient. </li>
            <li><strong>Pack light!</strong> Always have free space in your luggage for souvenirs and other things that could be bought during your trip.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan where to go before going.</strong> Navigating around towns in Japan, especially Tokyo isn't the easiest thing, as there are various places to go. 
                So, it would be time-saving to plan where to go during your trip.

        <h2 style="color: red; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">DON'Ts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Don't bring a lot of basic toiletries.</strong>
            Even the cheapest of Japanese hotels provide towels, 
            blankets and pillows, toothbrushes and toothpaste, soap and shampoo.</li>
            <li><strong>Too many clothes.</strong>: Same reason as the previous one, leave enough room in suitcase for possible souvenirs.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't buy a new bank card.</strong> Currency Exchange can be done through certain <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATMs</abbr> in convenience stores like <em>7/11</em> or <em>FamilyMart</em>.
            There are a lot of these stores all around Japan so it shouldn't be difficult to find these ATMs.</li>
