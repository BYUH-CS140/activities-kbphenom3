    <h1>What You Should Know When You Visit Japan (for about 2 weeks)</h1>
    <h2>DOs</h2>
    <h3>Passport: 
        <h4></h4>Really goes without saying that a passport is necessary to legally fly over there...</h3>
    <h3>IC Card: An IC card application can also be downloaded on iPhones for free</h3>
    <h3>eSIM: Buy a temporary eSIM for internet connection on the go. </h3>
    <h3>Light amount of clothes: pack light overall</h3>
    <h3></h3>
    <h2>Don'ts</h2>
    <h3>Don't bring a lot of basic toiletries: Even the cheapest of Japanese hotels provide towels, blankets and pillows, toothbrushes and toothpaste, soap and shampoo.</h3>
    <h3>Too many clothes: leave enough room in suitcase for possible souvenirs.</h3>
