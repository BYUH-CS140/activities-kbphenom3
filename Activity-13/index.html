    <p>After visiting Japan during this past spring break, I was inspired to make a website about essential things to do and NOT to do when visiting Japan, especially for the first time.</p>
    <p>Japan is a very popular destination for vacations amongst families and individuals. </p>
    <section class="dos" id="Dos">
        <h2>DOs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Passport</strong>: Really goes without saying that a passport is necessary to legally fly over there...</li>
            <li><strong>IC Card</strong>: An IC card is the most convenient method to pay for public transportation, and even normal transactions.
                An IC card application can also be downloaded on iPhones for free.
                <br><img src="images/iccard.jpg" alt="IC Cards" class="photo"></li>
            <li><strong>eSIM</strong>: A temporary eSIM for internet connection while going from place to place is very convenient. </li>
            <li><strong>Pack light!</strong> Always have free space in your luggage for souvenirs and other things that could be bought during your trip.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan where to go before going.</strong> Navigating around towns in Japan, especially Tokyo isn't the easiest thing, as there are various places to go. 
                So, it would be time-saving to plan where to go during your trip.

    <section class="donts" id="Donts">
        <h2>DON'Ts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Don't bring a lot of basic toiletries.</strong>
                Even the cheapest of Japanese hotels provide towels, 
                blankets and pillows, toothbrushes and toothpaste, soap and shampoo.</li>
            <li><strong>Too many clothes.</strong>: Same reason as the previous one, leave enough room in suitcase for possible souvenirs.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't buy a new bank card.</strong> Currency Exchange can be done through certain <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATMs</abbr> in convenience stores like <em>7/11</em> or <em>FamilyMart</em>.
                There are a lot of these stores all around Japan so it shouldn't be difficult to find these ATMs.

    <h2>My favorite foods from Japan:</h2>
    <section class="flex-columns" id="Foods">
        <div class="column">
            <h2>Shio Ramen</h2>

            <figcaption>Char Siu Shio Ramen + Ebi Chahan (Shrimp Fried Rice)</figcaption>
            <p>Ramen is a very popular dish in Japan, and it is one of my favorites.
                Unlike the ridiculous ramen prices in Hawaii, you can get a full bowl of ramen 
                and a dish of shrimp fried rice for a total of 1100 yen (~$7)!
            </p>

            <h2>Karaage</h2>

            </figure>
            <p>Karaage in literal translation is fried chicken which is popular in Japan that you can find in most Japanese convenience stores. 
                Funnily enough, I couldn't find these types of snacks that I enjoy in American 7/11s.

            <img src="images/kb1.jpg" alt="Me in Japan" class="float-image">
                <figcaption>I took a trip to the Tokyo Tower back when I went to Japan for the first time last year,
                and I had a great time there. The view was amazing, and the weather was perfect. 
                It was a great experience to see the city from such a high vantage point.
                Also, I got to see the recently-built Tokyo Skytree from the top of the tower.

                This picture was from earlier this year as I ventured through Takeshita Street which is the setting behind me.
                Takeshita Street is widely known for the various thrift and vintage stores that have tons of clothes that suits the
                current fashions of Japan.</p>

                    I found myself at the Tokyo Train Station (yes, there is a specific train station called Tokyo). 
                    The setting sun and the city aesthetic was too mesmerizing for me to not take a picture of the scene.</p>
